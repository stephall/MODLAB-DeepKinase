The assay for all enzymes contained 60 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 3 μM Na-orthovanadate, 1.2 mM DTT, 50 μg/ml PEG20000, 1 μM [γ-33P]-ATP (approx. 8×10^5 cpm per well), protein kinase (variable amounts; see Table 1), and substrate (variable amounts). Certain assays also contained 1 mM CaCl2, 4 mM EDTA, 5 μg/ml Phosphatidylserine and 1 μg/ml 1.2-Dioleyl-glycerol. The MYLK2, CAMK1D, CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, CAMK4, CAMKK2, DAPK2 and EEF2K assays additionally contained 1 μg/ml Calmodulin and 0.5 mM CaCl2. The PRKG1 and PRKG2 assays additionally contained 1 μM cGMP. Recombinant Protein Kinases: All protein kinases were expressed in Sf9 insect cells or in E. coli as recombinant GST-fusion proteins or His-tagged proteins. All kinases were produced from human cDNAs, except JAK2, for which the mouse cDNA was used. Kinases were purified by affinity chromatography using either GSH-agarose (Sigma) or Ni-NTH-agarose (Qiagen). The purity of the protein kinases was examined by SDS-PAGE/coomassie staining. The identity of the protein kinases was checked by mass spectroscopy. Assays were made under license from Chemicon International Inc. for JAK2.
