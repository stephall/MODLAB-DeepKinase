Compound was added to the enzyme/substrate mixture using acoustic technology (Labcyte Echo 550, Sunnyvale, Calif.) (see, Olechno et al., 2006, Improving IC50 results with acoustic droplet ejection. JALA 11, 240-246) and pre-incubated for 0, 15, or 60 minutes at room temperature. After compound pre-incubation, a mixture of ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) and 33P-γ-ATP (PerkinElmer) was added to a final concentration of 10 uM to initiate kinase reactions. Reactions were incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature and then spotted onto Whatman P81 ion exchange filter paper.

Reactions were incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature and then spotted onto Whatman P81 ion exchange filter paper. Unbound phosphate was removed by extensively washing filters in 0.75% phosphoric acid.
