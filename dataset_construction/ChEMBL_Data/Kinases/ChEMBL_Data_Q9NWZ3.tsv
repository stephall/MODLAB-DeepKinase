The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product.

The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product.

The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.

The extent of phosphorylation is measured using the IMAP technology (Molecular Devices) where the phosphorylated fluorescent substrate binds to the large M(III)-based nanoparticles which reduces the rotational speed of the substrate and thus increases its fluorescent polarization (FP). 20 μl reaction mixture contains 10 mM TriHCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 nM GST tagged IRAK-4 (SignalChem), 100 nM fluorescent peptide substrate (RP7030, Molecular Devices), 100 μM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. The reaction is initiated by the addition of ATP. After incubation for 30 minutes at 25° C., 60 μl of Progressive IMAP Reagent (Molecular Devices) is added to stop the reaction.

412025	17776740	CHEMBL3888668	Mobility Shift Assay: Agents: 1-fold kinase buffer without MnCl2: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT. 1-fold kinase buffer with MnCl2: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 2 mM DTT. Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction.
