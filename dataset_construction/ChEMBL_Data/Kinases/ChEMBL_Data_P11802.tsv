Compounds are serially diluted in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA) and added to the reaction mixture containing 2.5 ng/ml Cdk4/CyclinD1 or Cdk6/CyclinD3, 25 μM ATP, 10 μCi/ml [33P]-ATP, 0.1 μg/ml Rb in the kinase buffer. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and the proteins precipitated with an equal volume of 20% TCA. The plates are washed with 10% TCA according to the manufacturer's instruction and dried at room temperature. The amount of the phosphorylated Rb is determined with a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

His6-tagged recombinant human cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/cyclin B1, CDK2/cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK7/cyclin H were expressed in sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant cyclin D1 was expressed in E. coli. Proteins were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography to greater than 90% homogeneity. Kinase assays were performed in 96-well plates using recombinant CDK/cyclins, recombinant active ERK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology), or cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit (Calbiochem Cat. 539487). Assays were performed in assay buffer (25 mM beta -glycerophosphate, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO3, pH 7.4), into which were added 2-4 ug of active enzyme with appropriate substrates (purified histone H1 for CDK2, recombinant GST-retinoblastoma protein (residues 773-928) for CDK4.

His6-tagged recombinant human cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/cyclin B1, CDK2/cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK7/cyclin H were expressed in sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant cyclin D1 was expressed in E. coli. Proteins were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography to greater than 90% homogeneity. Kinase assays were performed in 96-well plates using recombinant CDK/cyclins, recombinant active ERK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology), or cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit (Calbiochem Cat. 539487). Assays were performed in assay buffer (25 mM beta -glycerophosphate, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO3, pH 7.4), into which were added 2-4 ug of active enzyme with appropriate substrates (purified histone H1 for CDK2, recombinant GST-retinoblastoma protein (residues 773-928) for CDK4.

His6-tagged recombinant human cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1/cyclin B1, CDK2/cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK7/cyclin H were expressed in sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. Recombinant cyclin D1 was expressed in E. coli. Proteins were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography to greater than 90% homogeneity. Kinase assays were performed in 96-well plates using recombinant CDK/cyclins, recombinant active ERK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology), or cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit (Calbiochem Cat. 539487).

In general, the kinase reactions were carried out in 20 uL volumes in the reaction solution, which is composed of 2 uL compound (in 20% DMSO), 8 uL CDK1/cyclin B in the 1x Reaction Buffer (Molecular Devices, Cat. No. R8139), 10 uL substrate mixture of Tamra Histone-H1 peptide (Molecular Devices, Cat. No. R7384) and ATP (Amersham Pharmacia, Cat. No. 27-2056-01) in the 1x Reaction Buffer with 1 mM DTT freshly added. The final reaction mixture contains compound (inhibitor) with the concentration varying from 0.005-10 uM, 2% DMSO, 0.25 nM CDK1/cyclin B, 100 nM Tamra Histone-H1 peptide, and 20 uM ATP.All reactions were run at room temperature in black 384-well flat-bottom Costar plates (Corning, Cat. No. 3710) for 120 min then were quenched.	B	CN(C)C(=O)c1cc2cnc(Nc3ccc(C(=O)N4C[C@@H]5CC[C@H](C4)N5C)cn3)nc2n1C1CCCC1		CHEMBL3691683	>	IC50	nM	15000.0	CHEMBL331	Homo sapiens	IC50	nM	15000.0

The protein substrate used in the assay is the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The kinase reactions are carried out in a 96-well filter plate (MSDV N6B50, Millipore). Compounds are serially diluted in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA) and added to the reaction mixture containing 2.5 ng/ml Cdk4/CyclinD1 or Cdk6/CyclinD3, 25 μM ATP, 10 μCi/ml [33P]-ATP, 0.1 μg/ml Rb in the kinase buffer. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and the proteins precipitated with an equal volume of 20% TCA. The plates are washed with 10% TCA according to the manufacturer's instruction and dried at room temperature. The amount of the phosphorylated Rb is determined with a TopCount (PerkinElmer).

Compounds are serially diluted in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA) and added to the reaction mixture containing 2.5 ng/ml Cdk4/CyclinD1 or Cdk6/CyclinD3, 25 μM ATP, 10 μCi/ml [33P]-ATP, 0.1 μg/ml Rb in the kinase buffer. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and the proteins precipitated with an equal volume of 20% TCA.

The reaction was stopped by adding 50 ul of stop-mix [100 uM ATP; 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0; 0.2% Triton X100; 0.125 mg of streptavidin-SPA Beads (GE Healthcare)]. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the SPA beads were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min; 1500 g).

The reaction was carried out in a 30 uL volume containing 0.3 nM CDK4/cyclin D1, 150 nM biotin-pRb (773-924), 3 uM ATP, and 1.3% DMSO (or compound in DMSO) in the assay buffer (50 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.5; 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Tween-20, and 0.05% BSA). 3 uM ATP was added last to initiate the reaction. The reaction was quenched with 10 uL of 240 mM EDTA-Na (pH 8.0) after 60 min incubation at 22 C.
