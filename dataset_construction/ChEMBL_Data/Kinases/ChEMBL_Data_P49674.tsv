273856	16259747	CHEMBL3707779	Kinase Inhibition Assay: The compound of Example 39, 2-(1H-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one, was subjected to a kinase inhibition assay for the kinases. Compounds were tested in 5 dose IC50 mode with 10-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM. Staurosporine, a known protein kinase inhibitor, was tested in 5-dose IC50 mode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 20 μM. Reactions were carried out in 10 μM ATP. The results are shown in Table 5. The results show that the compound of Example 39 is a kinase inhibitor highly selective for the kinase Plk2.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

The final assay volume was 30 ul prepared from 15 ul additions of enzyme, substrates (fluoresceinated peptide FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The final assay volume was 30 ul prepared from 15 ul additions of enzyme, substrates (fluoresceinated peptide FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.
