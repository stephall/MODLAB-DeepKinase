356941	17732604	CHEMBL3887841	Kinase Assay (Method B): The kinase activity of the bi-functional enzyme is readily quantified based on the production of ADP and F-2,6-P2 from ATP and F6P. The ADP is detected with a kit, ADP-Glo Kinase Assay(a-e), from Promega. The assay is a luminescent ADP detection assay that measures kinase activity by quantifying the amount of ADP produced during the kinase reaction. The assay is performed in two steps; first, after the kinase reaction, an equal volume of ADP-Glo Reagent is added to terminate the kinase reaction and deplete the remaining ATP. Second, the Kinase Detection Reagent is added to simultaneously convert ADP to ATP and allow the newly synthesized ATP to be measured using a luciferase/luciferine reaction.

(1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 191-5. This sensitive assay is based on the potent activation of pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase-1 (PPi-PFK) from potato tubers by F-2,6-P2. The use of a series of coupled enzymes leads to a consumption of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) that can be followed spectrophotometrically (an updated protocol is available in Van Schaftingen, (1984) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis (Bergmeyer, H.
