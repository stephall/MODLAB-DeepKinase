Five ul of a reaction mixture comprising IX reaction buffer (5x reaction buffer is 100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 3 mM DTT, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol water is added to each well of 384 well plates. Twenty-five nanoliters of a 1 mM test compound solution are added to test wells. Three ul of a 128 ng/ml IRE-1alpha preparation are added to each test well and to positive control wells (final concentration 5.82 ng/well). Negative control wells contain only reaction mixture and test compound.After spinning the plates at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds, 3 ul of an IRE-1alpha human mini-XBP-1 mRNA stem-loop substrate 5'-CAGUCCGCAGCACUG-3' (SEQ ID NO:1), labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5 at the 5' end and Black Hole Quencher 2.
