434697	17794658	CHEMBL3889107	Glucokinase-Activating Assay: To test the exemplified compounds, the following assay was employed. Recombinant human liver glucokinase was expressed as a FLAG fusion protein in E. coli, and purified on ANTIFLAG M2 AFFINITY GEL (Sigma). The assay was carried out at 30° C. in a 96-well plate. In the plate was distributed 69 ul each of assay buffer (25 mM Hepes Buffer: pH=7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TNAD, 1 mM dithiothreitol), to which was added 1 ul of a DMSO solution of the compound or DMSO as control. Then, 20 ul of pre-ice-cooled enzyme mixture (FLAG-GK, 20 U/ml G6PDH) was distributed thereto, to which was added 10 ul of 25 mM glucose as substrate to initiate the reaction (final glucose concentration=2.5 mM). After starting the reaction, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured every 30 seconds for 10 minutes to evaluate the compound based on the initial increase for 5 minutes. FLAG-GK was added so that the increase of absorbance after 5 minutes fell between 0.05 to 0.1 in the presence of 1% DMSO. The OD values of the respective compounds were measured in the respective concentrations, wherein the OD value of DMSO as control is regarded as 100%. From the OD values at the respective concentrations, Emax (%, 2.5 mM Glu) and EC50 (nM, 2.5 mM Glu) were calculated and used as indicators of the GK activation capability of the compounds. According to the above assay, the GK activation capability of the exemplified compounds of the present invention was determined. The following table shows the results.

In the plate was distributed 69 ul each of assay buffer (25 mM Hepes Buffer: pH=7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TNAD, 1 mM dithiothreitol), to which was added 1 ul of a DMSO solution of the compound or DMSO as control. Then, 20 ul of pre-ice-cooled enzyme mixture (FLAG-GK, 20 U/ml G6PDH) was distributed thereto, to which was added 10 ul of 25 mM glucose as substrate to initiate the reaction (final glucose concentration=2.5 mM). After starting the reaction, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured every 30 seconds for 10 minutes to evaluate the compound based on the initial increase for 5 minutes. FLAG-GK was added so that the increase of absorbance after 5 minutes fell between 0.05 to 0.1 in the presence of 1% DMSO. The OD values of the respective compounds were measured in the respective concentrations, wherein the OD value of DMSO as control is regarded as 100%. From the OD values at the respective concentrations, Emax (%, 2.5 mM Glu) and EC50 (nM, 2.5 mM Glu) were calculated and used as indicators of the GK activation capability of the compounds. According to the above assay, the GK activation capability of the exemplified compounds of the present invention was determined. The following table shows the results.

In the plate was distributed 69 ul each of assay buffer (25 mM Hepes Buffer: pH=7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TNAD, 1 mM dithiothreitol), to which was added 1 ul of a DMSO solution of the compound or DMSO as control. Then, 20 ul of pre-ice-cooled enzyme mixture (FLAG-GK, 20 U/ml G6PDH) was distributed thereto, to which was added 10 ul of 25 mM glucose as substrate to initiate the reaction (final glucose concentration=2.5 mM). After starting the reaction, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured every 30 seconds for 10 minutes to evaluate the compound based on the initial increase for 5 minutes. FLAG-GK was added so that the increase of absorbance after 5 minutes fell between 0.05 to 0.1 in the presence of 1% DMSO. The OD values of the respective compounds were measured in the respective concentrations, wherein the OD value of DMSO as control is regarded as 100%. From the OD values at the respective concentrations, Emax (%, 2.5 mM Glu) and EC50 (nM, 2.5 mM Glu) were calculated and used as indicators of the GK activation capability of the compounds. According to the above assay, the GK activation capability of the exemplified compounds of the present invention was determined. The following table shows the results.
