The reaction buffer conditions are 16 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DTT, 0.08% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, Germany, cat. no. A3059), 0.008% (w/v) Pluronic F127 (Sigma, Germany, cat. no. P2443), 3% (v/v) DMSO (Applichem, Germany, cat. no. A3006). The kinase reaction is at 30° C. for 40 min. The kinase reaction is terminated by addition of 0.67 reaction volumes of 1 μM antibody in 20 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, disodium salt (EDTA, Sigma, Germany, cat. no.

Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 uL of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 3.3 mM=>final conc. in the 5 uL assay volume is 2 mM) and substrate (0.1 uM=>final conc. in the 5 uL assay volume is 0.06 uM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 30 min at 22° C. The concentration of MKNK1 was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in tthe linear range, typical concentrations were in the range of 0.003 ug/mL. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 uL of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents (5 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France] and 1 nM anti-ribosomal protein S6 (pSer236)-antibody from Invitrogen [#44921G] and 1 nM LANCE EU-W1024 labeled ProteinG [Perkin-Elmer, product no.

Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μL of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μL assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (0.1 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μL assay volume is 0.06 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 45 min at 22 °C. The concentration of MKNK1 was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical concentrations were in the range of 0.05 μg/ml. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μL of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents (5 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France] and 1 nM anti-ribosomal protein S6 (pSer236)-antibody from Invitrogen [#44921G] and 1 nM LANCE EU-W1024 labeled ProteinG [Perkin-Elmer, product no. AD0071]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the formation of complex between the phosphorylated biotinylated peptide and the detection reagents. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the Eu-chelate to the streptavidine-XL. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm were measured in a TR-FRET reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate.

Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μL of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μL assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (0.1 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μL assay volume is 0.06 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 45 min at 22 °C. The concentration of MKNK1 was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical concentrations were in the range of 0.05 μg/ml. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μL of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents (5 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France] and 1 nM anti-ribosomal protein S6 (pSer236)-antibody from Invitrogen [#44921G] and 1 nM LANCE EU-W1024 labeled ProteinG [Perkin-Elmer, product no. AD0071]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the formation of complex between the phosphorylated biotinylated peptide and the detection reagents. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the Eu-chelate to the streptavidine-XL. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm were measured in a TR-FRET reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate.
