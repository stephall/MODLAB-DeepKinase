301076	16276923	CHEMBL3705982	ADP-Glo Kinase Assay: Inhibitor Concentration at 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50) values were calculated by quantifying the end-point ADP production from each kinase reaction using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.) as described by the manufacturer. Reactions were performed in Tris buffer (50 mM pH 7.5, RT) containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin. Each assay was performed in 60 uL of the solution in 10x75 mm borosilicate glass test tubes and allowed to continuously shake during the duration of the assay. The total ADP generated was quantified by transferring 25 uL (2x) of each assay to a 96-well luminescence assay plate, followed by the addition of 25 uL of ADP-Glo Reagent (45 min incubation) to remove any remaining ATP. For luminescence readings, 50 uL of Kinase Detection Reagent (45 min incubation) was added to convert the ADP generated from the kinase reaction to ATP, and luminescent intensity was measured using a luciferase/luciferin reaction.

301070	16339005	CHEMBL3705982	ADP-Glo Kinase Assay: Inhibitor Concentration at 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50) values were calculated by quantifying the end-point ADP production from each kinase reaction using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.) as described by the manufacturer. Reactions were performed in Tris buffer (50 mM pH 7.5, RT) containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin. Each assay was performed in 60 uL of the solution in 10x75 mm borosilicate glass test tubes and allowed to continuously shake during the duration of the assay. The total ADP generated was quantified by transferring 25 uL (2x) of each assay to a 96-well luminescence assay plate, followed by the addition of 25 uL of ADP-Glo Reagent (45 min incubation) to remove any remaining ATP. For luminescence readings, 50 uL of Kinase Detection Reagent (45 min incubation) was added to convert the ADP generated from the kinase reaction to ATP, and luminescent intensity was measured using a luciferase/luciferin reaction.

301062	16352966	CHEMBL3705982	ADP-Glo Kinase Assay: Inhibitor Concentration at 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50) values were calculated by quantifying the end-point ADP production from each kinase reaction using the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.) as described by the manufacturer. Reactions were performed in Tris buffer (50 mM pH 7.5, RT) containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin. Each assay was performed in 60 uL of the solution in 10x75 mm borosilicate glass test tubes and allowed to continuously shake during the duration of the assay. The total ADP generated was quantified by transferring 25 uL (2x) of each assay to a 96-well luminescence assay plate, followed by the addition of 25 uL of ADP-Glo Reagent (45 min incubation) to remove any remaining ATP. For luminescence readings, 50 uL of Kinase Detection Reagent (45 min incubation) was added to convert the ADP generated from the kinase reaction to ATP, and luminescent intensity was measured using a luciferase/luciferin reaction.
