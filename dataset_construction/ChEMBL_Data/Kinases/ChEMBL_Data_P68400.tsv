Assays for inhibition of CK2 by the instant compounds were performed in 384-well plates with reaction mixtures containing 10 uM of peptide substrate (RRRADDSDDDDD-NH2), [gamma-33P]ATP (10 uCi) at 25 uM (CK2A1) or 5 uM (CK2A2), 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, Brij-35 at 0.015%, and recombinant CK2A1 (10 nM, Invitrogen) or CK2A2 (5 nM, Upstate Biotechnology). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour, and reaction products were captured by binding to phosphocellulose (P81) filter plates.
