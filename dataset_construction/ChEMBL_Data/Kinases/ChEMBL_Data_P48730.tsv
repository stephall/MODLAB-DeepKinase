The GSK3beta peptide substrate was from American Peptide (Sunnyvale, Calif.; Cat 311153). 1 L/well of CABPE (22.5 nM GSK3beta , 8 uM peptide in AB buffer (12.5 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/mL BSA, 0.5 unit/mL Heparin)), 0.5 L/well of 125 uM of ATP, and 1 L/well of positive control 50 uM of GW8510 (positive control) or AB (DMSO only neutral control) in respective wells according to plate design using BioRAPTR (Beckman, Brea, Calif.). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. 2.5 uL/well of ADP-Glo (Promega, V9103) was added with BioRAPTR, and incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes followed by addition of 5 uL/well of ADP-Glo detection reagent (Promega, V9103) with Combi nL (Thermo, Waltham, Mass.).

The solutions of the compounds according to the invention at these various concentrations are prepared by diluting in a test buffer (Tris 50 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 M, DTT 2 mM and EGTA 1 mM) a stock solution in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The ""U""-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the ""U""-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner. The radiation emitted by each well is then measured for 2 minutes in a TopCount NXT Packard scintillation counter, in which the values of CPM/well are measured."

Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction.

The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.

The final assay volume was 30 ul prepared from 15 ul additions of enzyme, substrates (fluoresceinated peptide FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 22 hours and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.
