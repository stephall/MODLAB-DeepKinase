273867	16277341	CHEMBL3707700	Kinase Inhibition Assay: The compound of Example 39, 2-(1H-indol-5-ylamino)-6-(2,4-difluorophenylsulfonyl)-8-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one, was subjected to a kinase inhibition assay for the kinases. Compounds were tested in 5 dose IC50 mode with 10-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM. Staurosporine, a known protein kinase inhibitor, was tested in 5-dose IC50 mode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 20 μM. Reactions were carried out in 10 μM ATP. The results are shown in Table 5. The results show that the compound of Example 39 is a kinase inhibitor highly selective for the kinase Plk2.

The technology is a competition binding assay that profiled the selectivity of compound 2 against 350 kinases, each fused to a proprietary tag. The quantity of each kinase bound to an immobilized, active site-directed ligand was measured in the presence and absence of compound 2.

412052	17776767	CHEMBL3888695	Mobility Shift Assay: Agents: 1-fold kinase buffer without MnCl2: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT. 1-fold kinase buffer with MnCl2: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 2 mM DTT. Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction.

The kinase reaction was then started by adding 3 μl of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1.67 mM→final concentration in 5 μl assay volume=1 mM) and substrate (1.67 μM→final concentration in 5 μl assay volume=1 μM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22° C. The concentration of the Tie2 fusion protein was adapted to the respective activity of the enzyme and adjusted such that the assay was carried out in the linear range. Typical concentrations were in the range of 30 ng/ml. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents [200 nM streptavidin-XL665 and 2 nM PT66-Eu chelate, a europium chelate-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin-Elmer); alternatively, it is also possible to use PT66-Tb cryptate (Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France)] in aqueous EDTA solution [90 mM EDTA, 0.28% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5]. The resulting mixture was incubated at 22° C. for 1 h to allow formation of the complex of the biotinylated phosphorylated substrate and the detection reagents. The amount of phosphorylated substrate was then determined by measuring the resonance energy transfer from PT66-Eu chelate to streptavidin-XL665. To this end, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm were measured in a TR-FRET measuring instrument (for example Viewlux, Perkin-Elmer).

The kinase reaction was then started by adding 3 μl of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1.67 mM→final concentration in 5 μl assay volume=1 mM) and substrate (1.67 μM→final concentration in 5 μl assay volume=1 μM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22° C. The concentration of the Tie2 fusion protein was adapted to the respective activity of the enzyme and adjusted such that the assay was carried out in the linear range. Typical concentrations were in the range of 30 ng/ml. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents [200 nM streptavidin-XL665 and 2 nM PT66-Eu chelate, a europium chelate-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin-Elmer); alternatively, it is also possible to use PT66-Tb cryptate (Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France)] in aqueous EDTA solution [90 mM EDTA, 0.28% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5]. The resulting mixture was incubated at 22° C. for 1 h to allow formation of the complex of the biotinylated phosphorylated substrate and the detection reagents. The amount of phosphorylated substrate was then determined by measuring the resonance energy transfer from PT66-Eu chelate to streptavidin-XL665. To this end, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm were measured in a TR-FRET measuring instrument (for example Viewlux, Perkin-Elmer).

Typical concentrations were in the range of 30 ng/ml. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of a solution of TR-FRET detection reagents [200 nM streptavidin-XL665 and 2 nM PT66-Eu chelate, a europium chelate-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin-Elmer); alternatively, it is also possible to use PT66-Tb cryptate (Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France)] in aqueous EDTA solution [90 mM EDTA, 0.28% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5]. The resulting mixture was incubated at 22° C. for 1 h to allow formation of the complex of the biotinylated phosphorylated substrate and the detection reagents. The amount of phosphorylated substrate was then determined by measuring the resonance energy transfer from PT66-Eu chelate to streptavidin-XL665. To this end, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm were measured in a TR-FRET measuring instrument (for example Viewlux, Perkin-Elmer).
