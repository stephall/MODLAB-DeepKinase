212968	17602421	CHEMBL3705235	ATR Inhibition Assay: Assays were carried out in a mixture of 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. Final substrate concentrations were 10 μM [γ-33P]ATP (3mCi 33P ATP/mmol ATP, Perkin Elmer) and 800 μM target peptide (ASELPASQPQPFSAKKK). Assays were carried out at 25° C. in the presence of 5 nM full-length ATR. An assay stock buffer solution was prepared containing all of the reagents listed above, with the exception of ATP and the test compound of interest. 13.5 μL of the stock solution was placed in a 96 well plate followed by addition of 2 μL of DMSO stock containing serial dilutions of the test compound (typically starting from a final concentration of 15 μM with 3-fold serial dilutions) in duplicate (final DMSO concentration 7%). The plate was pre-incubated for 10 minutes at 25° C. and the reaction initiated by addition of 15 μL [γ-33P]ATP (final concentration 10 μM). The reaction was stopped after 24 hours by the addition of 30 μL 0.1M phosphoric acid containing 2 mM ATP. A multiscreen phosphocellulose filter 96-well plate (Millipore, Cat no. MAPHN0B50) was pretreated with 100 μL 0.2M phosphoric acid prior to the addition of 45 μL of the stopped assay mixture. The plate was washed with 5×200 μL 0.2M phosphoric acid. After drying, 100 μL Optiphase 'SuperMix' liquid scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) was added to the well prior to scintillation counting (1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter, Wallac).

After 1 h incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO2, 40 nl of 3 mM 4NQO in 100% DMSO was added to all wells by acoustic dispensing, except minimum control wells which were left untreated with 4NQO to generate a null response control. Plates were returned to the incubator for a further 1 h. Then cells were fixed by adding 20 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS solution and incubating for 20 mins at r.t. Then 20 μl of 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS was added and incubated for 10 minutes at r.t., to permeabalise cells. Then the plates were washed once with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Phospho-Chk1 Ser 345 antibody (Cell Signalling Technology #2348) was diluted 150 fold in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 15 μl was added to each well and incubated over night at r.t. The next morning plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and then 20 μl of secondary Ab solution, containing 500 fold diluted Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes #A-11008) and 0.002 mg/ml Hoeschst dye (Molecular Probes #H-3570), in PBST, was added. After 2 h incubation at r.t., the plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and plates were then sealed with black plate seals until read. Plates were read using an ArrayScan VTI instrument, using an XF53 filter with 10× objective. A two laser set up was used to analyse nuclear staining with Hoeschst (405 nm) and secondary antibody staining of pChk1 (488 nm).
