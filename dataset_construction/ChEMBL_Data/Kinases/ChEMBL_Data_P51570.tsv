435785	17795746	CHEMBL3887026	qHTS Assay: Assay details and protocol: The primary assay monitored ATP depletion using Promega's KinaseGlo technology, where ATP levels are measured through luminescence generated from firefly luciferase, a bioluminescent ATP-dependent enzymes. ATP was held at 35 μM, near its reported KM value, and the KM for galactose was determined under the 1536-well assay conditions to be 50-100M (FIG. 1A).
