Kinase and inhibitors were pre-incubated for 10 minutes prior to the addition of PIP2 substrate. 5 uL of 5x kinase reaction buffer were added in each well followed by the further addition of 5 uL/well of PIP2 substrate. Then distilled H2O was added to each well so as to make up a final volume of 25 uL/well. Incubation was done at rt for 1 hour which was followed by washing the wells 3 times with 200 uL of 1xTBST per well and then 2 times with 200 uL of IX TBS per well. Then 100 uL of the Substrate TMB per well was added and then to keep for colour development in the dark.

Excitation of Europium in the complex results in an energy transfer to the APC and a fluorescent emission at 665 nm.

351135	17727304	CHEMBL3887745	Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence Assay: The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit the activity of four PI3K isoforms, PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ, were determined using a commercially available lipid kinase assay run in Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) format. Assay DescriptionAssay principle: The PIP3 product is detected by displacement of biotin-PIP3 from an energy transfer complex consisting of Europium labeled anti-GST monoclonal antibody, a GST-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, biotinylated PIP3 and Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin (APC).

356698	17732361	CHEMBL3887828	Enzyme Inhibition Assay: The PI3K enzymes catalyse the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ ions. The PIP3 product can be detected by displacement of biotin-PIP3 from energy transfer complexes consisting of europium labelled anti-GST monoclonal antibody, a GST-tagged Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, biotinylated PIP3 and streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC) by the time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) (HTRF PI3K enzyme assay, Millipore). Excitation, at 330 nm, of europium in the complex results in an energy transfer to the APC and a fluorescent emission at 665 nm although europium itself emits at its characteristic wavelength of 620 nm. The PIP3 product formed by PI3K activity displaces biotin-PIP3 from the complex and results in a loss of energy transfer (decreasing signal).The compound to be tested was added, at the desired final concentrations, to a mixture of PIP2 substrate.

445460	17805168	CHEMBL3889293	Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) Assay: The activities were measured using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. TR-FRET monitored the formation of 3,4,5-inositol triphosphate molecule that competed with fluorescently labeled PIP3 for binding to the GRP-1 pleckstrin homology domain protein. An increase in phosphatidylinositide 3-phosphate product resulted in a decrease in TR-FRET signal as the labeled fluorophore was displaced from the GRP-1 protein binding site. Class I PI3K isoforms were expressed and purified as heterodimeric recombinant proteins. All assay reagents and buffers for the TR-FRET assay were purchased from Millipore. PI3K isoforms were assayed under initial rate conditions in the presence of 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), and 2xKm ATP (75-500 uM), 2 uM PIP2, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Chaps, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% (v/v) DMSO at the following concentrations for each isoform: PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kδ between 25 and 50 uM, and PI3Kγ at 2 nM. The compounds of Table 1 and Compound X ((S)-2,4-diamino-6-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile) and Compound Y ((S)-2,4-diamino-6-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile) were added to the assay solution and incubated for 30 minutes at 25° C.
