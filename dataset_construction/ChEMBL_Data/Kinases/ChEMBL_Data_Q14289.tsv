428150	17789820	CHEMBL3888996	Biochemical Assay: To measure inhibitory activity of FAK/PYK2 inhibitors, compounds were first prepare as a 1 mM stock in 100% DMSO and 3-fold serial dilution was performed in a 96-well plate (Corning, 3897) to generate 12 different concentration of 100× stock. A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock. Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100). For PYK2, 5 μl of 2 nM PYK2 and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 46.6 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100).

Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100).

Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100).

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock. Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100). For PYK2, 5 μl of 2 nM PYK2 and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 46.6 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100).
