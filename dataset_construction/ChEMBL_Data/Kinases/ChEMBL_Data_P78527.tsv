The DNA-PK was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the 1050 of the Compounds, serial 1:3 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2 U/uL). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 200 uM DNA substrate and then ATP was added to a final 75 uM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37° C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Fluorescence counts were read in a EnVision instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (550 and 590 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively).

The DNA-PK was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the 1050 of the Compounds, serial 1:3 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2 U/uL). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 200 uM DNA substrate and then ATP was added to a final 75 uM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37° C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Fluorescence counts were read in a EnVision instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (550 and 590 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). Values were normalized against the control activity included for each enzyme (i.e., 100% DNA_PK kinase activity, without compound). These values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and were fit to a sigmoid dose-response curve by using the model sigmoidal Four-Parameter Logistc implement for Activity base - software.

The enzyme, DNA-PK was purchased from Promega (#V5811). The assay was done following the manufacturer recommendations with slight modifications: Mainly the kinase buffer was replace by 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/mL BGG, 0.02% Tween 20. The DNA-PK was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the 1050 of the Compounds, serial 1:3 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2 U/uL). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 200 uM DNA substrate and then ATP was added to a final 75 uM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37° C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Fluorescence counts were read in a EnVision instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (550 and 590 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively).

To calculate the 1050 of the Compounds, serial 1:3 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2 U/uL). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 200 uM DNA substrate and then ATP was added to a final 75 uM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37° C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Fluorescence counts were read in a EnVision instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (550 and 590 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). Values were normalized against the control activity included for each enzyme (i.e., 100% DNA_PK kinase activity, without compound). These values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and were fit to a sigmoid dose-response curve by using the model sigmoidal Four-Parameter Logistc implement for Activity base - software.

The enzyme, DNA-PK was purchased from Promega (#V5811). The assay was done following the manufacturer recommendations with slight modifications: Mainly the kinase buffer was replace by 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/mL BGG, 0.02% Tween 20. The DNA-PK was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the 1050 of the Compounds, serial 1:3 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2 U/uL). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 200 uM DNA substrate and then ATP was added to a final 75 uM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37° C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at RT. Fluorescence counts were read in a EnVision instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (550 and 590 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively).
