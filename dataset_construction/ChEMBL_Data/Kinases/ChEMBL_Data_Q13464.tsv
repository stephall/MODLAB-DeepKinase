351443	17727612	CHEMBL3887751	In Vitro Assay: The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as ROCK inhibitors can be determined in a 30 μL assay containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij-35, 4 mM DTT, 5 μM ATP and 1.5 μM peptide substrate (FITC-AHA-AKRRRLSSLRA-OH). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO was <2%, and the reaction was initiated with Rho kinase variants. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides separated using a LabChip 3000 Reader (Caliper Life Sciences).

The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat.

The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET.
