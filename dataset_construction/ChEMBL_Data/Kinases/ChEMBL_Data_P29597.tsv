312371	17692588	CHEMBL3887154	Competition Binding Assay: For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at room temperature to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1x binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 34 uL, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 uL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hr, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 uM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound.

335043	17713261	CHEMBL3887375	Enzymatic Assay: Methods: A peptide mobility shift assay was used to quantify the phosphorylation of the JAKtide (JAK-2 and JAK-3) or the IRS-1 peptide (JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate (Matrical MP-101) in a 10 microliter total volume. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 micromolar for JAK-2 and JAK-3, 40 micromolar for JAK-1 and 7 micromolar for Tyk-2)), 2% DMSO and 1 micromolar peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK-2 and JAK-3 or IRS-1 peptide for JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 microliter reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK-2, 1 nM JAK-3, 7 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK-1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK-1, 150 minutes for JAK-2, 90 minutes for JAK-3.

370428	17745294	CHEMBL3888066	JAK Enzymatic Assay: Methods: A peptide mobility shift assay was used to quantify the phosphorylation of the JAKtide (JAK-2 and JAK-3) or the IRS-1 peptide (JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate (Matrical MP-101) in a 10 microliter total volume. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 micromolar for JAK-2 and JAK-3, 40 micromolar for JAK-1 and 7 micromolar for Tyk-2)), 2% DMSO and 1 micromolar peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK-2 and JAK-3 or IRS-1 peptide for JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 microliter reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK-2, 1 nM JAK-3, 7 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK-1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK-1, 150 minutes for JAK-2, 90 minutes for JAK-3 and 60 minutes for Tyk-2.
